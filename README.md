## **Overview**

The goal of this project was to develop a full stack web app using the skills we have developed at General Assembly (GA) using React.js, NODE, and a noSQL database. GA is surrounded by many food markets frequented by students of the school, and a hot topic of conversation is always what stalls and dishes are the best, and how much they cost.

This webapp is designed to be a user driven database of food avaliable at markets near the user and beyond. Users are capable of uploading photos and details of what they have eaten at a market (including location), rating them, and also rating other dishes inputted by other users on the database.

# **Image Handling**
Image uploads and displaying were handled with 2 different packages in this project. Uploads were handled using Filestack, a 3rd party service designed to return a URL and apply transformations when an image is uploaded. This is acheived easily in react using the package "react-filestack".

Image displays are handled using Slick, specifically using the package "react-slick", which is an image carousel package designed to easily let you display images in a carousel.
