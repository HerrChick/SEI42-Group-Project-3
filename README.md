## **Overview**

## **Process**

We all collaborated from the same repo, this required us to work in close coordination making sure that we followed proper git version control.  We started off with a Kanban Trello board following the [MoSCoW method](https://agilekrc.com/resource/115/streetwise-moscow-ultimate-how-guide-moscow-prioritisation).

We then deployed our finish product from our development branch to master and the Heroku cloud platform.

## **Challenges**
  For creating the rating system we added the StarRating package. The main challenge was to pull the rating data from the api, since it was nested inside the comments array. To be able to send changes to the database, we needed cache user changes in the UI and then amalgamate the varying input sources together for submission to the server.
